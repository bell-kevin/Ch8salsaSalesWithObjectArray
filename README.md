# Ch8salsaSalesWithObjectArray

This is the same project as the previous one, Sales Sales with Parallel Arrays, except that instead of parallel arrays, you will use a single array of class objects. Create a class for Product that has a string for the name and an integer for the sales of the product, and instantiate 5 objects, one of each type of salsa, stored in an array of Products. As in the previous project, ask the user for the sales numbers. Display the list of salsas and sales, and determine total and the highest and lowest selling products. Use the same functions as in the previous project, modified to handle the single array of objects instead of parallel arrays.

Here is an example of the results -- note that it looks very similar to the previous project

Use the same table of test cases created for the previous project, Salsa Sales with Parallel Arrays. Run the project 3 times, using the numbers from each test case, and take screenshots of the results.

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots, the table of test cases  AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
